# SimpliCRM
Team Edoi's submission for the Google Workspace Hackathon 2024. 

SimpliCRM is a lightweight, open-source CRM designed for micro to small enterprises. Built on top of Google Workspace Add-On and Google Extension, SimpliCRM integrates seamlessly with Google Workspace tools, offering a powerful yet user-friendly solution for managing customer relationships and streamlining business operations.

## App-Script
[App-Script](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1FRgpDLeCT2nNKq-qoQeQ55DMikMb8FePbCDVkTs2Cxg8Tt7F9ABa3H-P/edit?pli=1) used in our solution. 
**PS : Our NOTION API KEY is not included in the app-script hence Notion Authorization won't run.**
